Minesweeper is played by clicking a tile to uncover the square below. Maybe you'll get lucky and the board will open up for you, or you may have to take a chance on another square. Once a space opens up for you on the board, you can use the numbers to give you logical clues about where the surrounding mines could be.

 When there is nothing left but covered mines on the board, you win!

 If you step on a mine, you lose. Simple as that. Or is it?

Don't feel bad when you lose, this is a game of chance in the end. -F
